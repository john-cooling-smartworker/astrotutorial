This post should show up with my other blog posts, because `import.meta.glob()` is returning a list of all my posts in order to create my list.
## 12 Rules

### Rule 1. In-depth research first
Until an equity is **ranked** for quality and value don’t buy it.
### Rule 2. Track your triggers
If the current price approaches a trigger range review and act.
### Rule 3. Keep the focus
Only a small number of companies can be on the priority list because of the work required to do in-depth analysis.
### Rule 4. Watch the market
The general watchlist should also be kept small, the total number of entities on the watch lists under 100. Watch out for the catalysts that result in movement.
Use the market to guide when it's time to buy and sell. The market assessment is there because the state of the market is more important than the individual company. It has to be considered for every action in the portfolio.
### Rule 5. Rank the market
Are there much better companies to invest elsewhere in the market?
- ***Calculate the value compared to peer companies, is it in the top quartile***
- ***Calculate the value compared to historical value and historical growth***
- ***Calculate value compared to the market ASX300***
### Rule 6. Liquidity Rule
If a stock's liquidity is less than $200,000  traded per day, never hold more than 20% of its daily liquid value.
### *Rule 7. Buy in portions.*
General rule is to buy the allocation in 3 portions as the price continues to show strength.
### *Rule 8. Cut and Run*
Cut your losses  short  and let your profits run. This is to manage your  "reward-to-risk ratio", calculated by dividing your average win by your average loss over a sample of investments.
### *Rule 9. Use a stop loss (Cut)*
Stop loss setting takes emotion out of dumping a loser.
Option 1. Look for a clear trading range and set stop loss at the bottom of the range.
Option 2. Use a multiple of the ATR 2 or 3 is common
### *Rule 10. Use a trailing stop loss (Run)*
One of the best ways to let go of the fear of losing your profit , and at the same time allow an investment to achieve its full potential, is to use a “trailing stop loss”. In its most basic sense, a trailing stop loss is simply an exit order in which you move in the direction of the intended investment. When you buy a stock, you want the price to go up. So, a trailing stop loss should only move higher (i.e., never lower!).
### *Rule 11. Use a 1 week delay on technical indicators*
*eg 1 week delay on EMA's to confirm the turn is real  and not just a temporary swerve.*
### *Rule 12. Strike Rate.*
Calculate your strike rate and monitor it all the time. work to improve your strike rate.
